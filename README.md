# Computer Vision Practices

This repository contains implementations of various typical Computer Vision tasks. These implementations are developed as part of coursework assignments, aiming to understand and improve upon the performance of each approach in various core aspect in Computer Vision.

## VNU - HCM University of Science

## Course: Advanced Computer Vision

## Implementation:

P01: **Morphological Operations**
  - Implement morphological operators and compare them with existing predefined libraries (OpenCV).
  - Morphological operators are highly effective for image preprocessing tasks.
  
P02: **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
  - Study the working mechanism of the GAN model.
  - Implement both the traditional GAN and DCGAN models to compare their performance in the task of unconditional handwritten digit image generation (MNIST).

P03: **Vision Transformer (ViT)**
  - Investigate the revolutionary changes introduced by Vision Transformers, their operational mechanism, and their advantages and disadvantages in computer vision.
  - Implement and experiment with a Vision Transformer model from scratch for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  - Experiment with different hyperparameters and compare the results.

## Dependencies:
